The mission was to collect hundreds of ads and analyse them using a custom grid and my team then processed this data so that it was valid for use in the calculator. This was to enable anyone to drop an ad into the calaculator and it would tell you the best and worst parts and where it could be imroved. This tock months of analising ads and comparing campaingns based on roi and click perfomance and splitting the results across the funnel to provid useful insights. I was responsible for designing the grid and building the calculator.",

We rebuilt it with a fully responsive and redesigned font-end with progressive web app features along with a seperate styleguide. We customised the saved items for all social sharing and custom wish lists. Along with a custom live chat widget and help desk and custom blocks for reuse through the site. I rebuilt the whole email system for both marketing and transactional with mjml and templated them so that anyone could create emails. There where also two more re-skins as part of this project a seperate site for launching unique items built in angular and a seperate blog built on wordpress.",
